## Extra Credit
* The title of slide 60 in week 5: Parsers, parsers, everywhere!
* I believe this title is referencing to the famous phrase from [“The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” by Samuel Taylor Coleridge](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43997/the-rime-of-the-ancient-mariner-text-of-1834). The poem recounts the experiences of a sailor. In this particular excerpt, the sailer is stranded at sea with saltwater all around him, but he cannot drink any of it. This translates to a situation where despite being surrounded by something, you cannot benefit from it.  

```
Water, water, every where,
And all the boards did shrink;
Water, water, every where,
Nor any drop to drink.
```
