## Assignment 6

* [index.js](index.js): The node.js server that fingerprints the browsers.
* [index.html](index.html): The HTML file that is displayed to the each client.
* [log.json](log.json): The JSON file that logs/fingerprints each client.

I wrote a server code that fingerprints each browser and writes these into a log. The code is also able to recognize each client and see if they have visited before. I used Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and my iPhone to test the fingerprinting algorithm.
