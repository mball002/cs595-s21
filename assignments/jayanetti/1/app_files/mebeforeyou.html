<h1>My Favourite Romantic Movie</h1>

<p>Me before you is one of my favourite movies of all time. The plot is based on a romantic novel from 2012 by Jojo Moyes. <br/>The GOT star Emilia Clark is playing the main role where she is a spirited 26-year-old from a struggling middle-class family. <br/>While most love stories have a happy ending, this story depicts how even true love has its limits and sad endings.</p>
